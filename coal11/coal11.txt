what happens when we are trying to multiplying two 8 bit numbers and in result we will get a 16-bit number. We have 16 bit registers but we will not use them we will only use 8-bit registers and see how can we store this 16-bit result in 8 bit registers. 
this same logic we can apply to multiply two 16 bit numbers or to multiply two 32-bit numbers or to multiply two 64-bit numbers or to multiply two 128-bit numbers.
so what is the idea? that if we know we have two n-bit numbers even then we can also multiply these n-bit numbers
in this prev lec we saw two shifting and one add operation 
in this lecture, we have a number of 16 bits but have space of 8-bits, so here we want to see how can we do add and shifting operations on these type of numbers and spaces.
it is not complicated. operation in itself is very simple. let's start with shift:
lets recall the SHL (Shift Logical Left)
in SHL, MSB fall in the carry bit and a 0 is place in the LSB and RCL (Rotate through Carry Left)
In RCL, already placed carry bit in CF go to the LSB and MSB bit fall in the carry bit
Now combine both and imply then on a 16-bit number
				LSB
			|c| -> |0|0|1|1|0|1|1|0|
	MSB
|c| -> |1|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|
see above is a 16 bit number we do SHL most significant bit of the LSB will fall into the carry, 0 will be placed in the least significant bit of LSB 
				LSB
			|0| -> |0|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|
	MSB
|c| -> |1|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|
in RCL, carry bit of the LSB will go into the least significant bit of MSB and the most significant bit of the MSB will fall in the carry bit.
				LSB
			|c| -> |0|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|
	MSB
|1| -> |0|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|
so now we can do shift left operation on 16-bit numbers same as opposite we can do shift right operations on it
