so it is obvious code segment also starts from any address of the memory. that address will be stored in the CS register, it is a specialized register that holds the starting address or base addres  of the ocde segment in memory and to access or refer the address (0100) we write (cs: 0100)
now if you run any asm language program in the afd and see the cs register value you will see same size values from where code segment starts, like for example 19F5 (2 bytes and four nibles) because register is 16 bits. so what the relation of this with the memory short comes, that is our processor who knows that logically this is not 19F5 that is 19F50 from where our code segment starts.
we will can only see 19F5 but logically processor adds hexadeciaml 0 with it and make it 19F50.
Now adding this hexa zero that makes them 5 bytes means now it can create memory of 0 to 2 raise to the power of 5 which is 1Mega byte (mb) that is also not so much in comparison of today but that makes the foundation of the memory in the coming architectures.
